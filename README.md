# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Python using Pytorch)

I have developed a RBM on famous movie lens dataset. However the output are changed to binary outputs is the user gave 0 or 1 or 2 star rating then didn't like the movie in other cases liked the movie. The model is trained on a batch size of 250 and 10 epochs with 100 hidden neurons. The training error is 22.86% whereas the test set error is 21.58% that is the model is able to correctly predict every 3 movies correctly out of 4. 

Note - The mentioned model training time is in seconds which later on updated to minutes.
